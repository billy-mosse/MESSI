# A MESSI system analyzer

## A little program that provides rate constants which witness multistationarity of MESSI systems that satisfy conditions stated in Theorem 5.4 of "[The Structure of MESSI Biological Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08763)", by Alicia Dickenstein and Mercedes Pérez Millán. (Under construction.)
