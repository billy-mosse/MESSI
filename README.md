# A MESSI system analyzer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/billy-mosse/MESSI.png)](https://travis-ci.com/billy-mosse/MESSI)

A simple program that provides rate constants which witness multistationarity of MESSI systems that satisfy conditions stated in Theorem 5.4 of "[The Structure of MESSI Biological Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08763)", by Alicia Dickenstein and Mercedes Pérez Millán. (Under construction.)

## What is it useful for?

Under development. [Visualization of (hoping: big) networks, analysis of multistationarity. It doesn't clean the dishes though.]

<!-- This program does amazing stuff -->

## Installation

Under development. When the project is finished, an executable file will be released for each major platform:
 - Windows (32 and 64 bit)
 - Linx (32 and 64 bit)
 - Mac OS X (32 and 64 bit)

## Example usage (it's really easy!):

Under development. The program will have a `--help` command and example networks to play with!

### How to analyze a custom network

Under development.

#### But, is my system MESSI?

Under development. You may check the conditions manually in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08763), for now.

### Examples (built-in MESSI networks)

![Example built with the program](https://github.com/billy-mosse/MESSI/blob/master/code/phosphorylation_cascade_circo.png)

Under development

### How to test the project

Assuming you have python 3 installed, just run `python tests.py`.

Current (passing) tests:

- test_buildup_of_conformal_circuit_to_matrix

Asserts that we can correctly build a circuit conformal to a given matrix.

- test_buildup_of_incidence_matrix_from_network

Asserts that we can correctly build the incidence matrix from a given (MESSINetwork) network.

- test_buildup_of_complexes_matrix_from_network

Asserts that we can correctly build the educt complexes matrix from a given (MESSINetwork) network.

- test_buildup_of_stoichiometric_matrix_from_network

Asserts that we can correctly build the stoichiometric matrix from a given (MESSINetwork) network.

If the README has build/passing, everything's OK! It means that the tests aren't failing.

<!-- ##### How to process a big network -->

<!-- Hello! I'm a comment. I won't appear in the README file in github. In this section we have to write something like "just run python3 main.py and amazing stuff will happen"-->
